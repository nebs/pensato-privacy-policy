# Privacy Policy
This policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the Pensato iOS app for iPhone and iPad.

## Information we collect
The app doesn't collect or store any information about your scales, chords, searches, etc. The scales you pick and settings you choose are only saved on the device itself (if you delete the app, that information is gone).

## Ads and analytics
Pensato uses a 3rd party service called Crashlytics to send crash reports. This data only contains technical information to help me debug the crash and doesn't include any of your personal information. View Crashlytic's privacy policy here: https://try.crashlytics.com/terms/privacy-policy.pdf

## Third-party links and content
Pensato displays web links to external sites in the "Credits" section. These links open an external browser and aren't affiliated or related to the Pensato app. These website may have their own separate privacy policies.

## Your Consent
